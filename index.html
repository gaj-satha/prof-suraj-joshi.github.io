<h3>He is sick, very sick (and so is his stupid boyfriend). But Gaj Satha, the champion of Mississauga,
will perform <a href="electrotherapy/index.html">Electrotherapy</a> on him and will cure him completely.</h3>
<h3> He is taking zolpidem 10mg to regularize my sleep! Also astaxanthin, as he can read without glasses after 3 months of dosing</h3>
