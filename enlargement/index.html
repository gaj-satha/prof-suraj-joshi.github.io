<br/><b><u><h1><center>ELECTROTHERAPY</center></h1></u></b><br/><br/>
<h3>Electrotherapy is a magical procedure which can cure all sort of mental disease. In common terms, it can be described
as <i>&quot;Dimag thikane pe laga dena&quot;</i>. It is planned to be performed on Prof. Suraj Joshi and to straighten
him up.<br/><br/>
The procedure involves shaving off the head of the victim and hanging him upside down from ceiling. Then attaching
electrodes to his head and administer electric shocks.<br/><br/>
It is important to make sure that the victim is bald because hairs would absorb currents and will diminish the effects
of electric shocks. Also, the victim should be hanged upside down because all the blood will flow towards the brain.
This will cure the victim faster!</h3><br/>
